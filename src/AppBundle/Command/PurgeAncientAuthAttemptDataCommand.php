/**
 * Purger command which removes ancient auth attempt logs.
 *
 * Every attempt log item which hasn't been modified for at least ~6 months will be seen
 * as not relevant anymore and will be removed therefore.
 *
 * The attempt models are lightweight items counting failed authentications of a certain IP against
 * a user account, but if no failed authentications from an API do happen anymore or due to a false-positive
 * in the code which erases IPs from the blacklist when the login succeeds, the log is obsolete
 * and must be removed.
