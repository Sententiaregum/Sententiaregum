Feature: pending activations cluster
    In order to increase the speed of pending approval requests, a lightweight key checker implementation
    using a redis cluster is necessary

    Background:
        Given the database is purged
        And there's an activation key stored in redis

    Scenario: approving key
        When I try to approve it
        Then the key should be marked as approvable

    Scenario: expired key
        Given the activation key is expired
        When I try to approve it
        Then the key should not be approvable

    Scenario: expired key, but database backup
        Given the key was removed from redis due to server issues
        When I try to approve it
        Then the key should be marked as approvable
