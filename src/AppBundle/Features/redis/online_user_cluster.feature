@online_users
Feature: cluster for online users
    In order to store users a cluster containing all user ids is necessary

    Background:
        Given the following users exist:
            | user_id | username | password | email                     |
            | 123-abc | Ma27_2   | 123456   | Ma27_2@sententiaregum.dev |
            | foo-2ab | ben      | 123456   | ben@sententiaregum.dev    |
            | bar-baz | test     | 123456   | test@sententiaregum.dev   |
        And the user with id "123-abc" will be marked as online

    Scenario: register online users in a cluster
        When I'd like to know the state of the following user ids:
            | user_id |
            | 123-abc |
            | bar-baz |
        Then I should see the following result:
            | user_id | state |
            | 123-abc | true  |
            | bar-baz | false |
