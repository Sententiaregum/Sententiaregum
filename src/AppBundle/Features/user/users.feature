@users
Feature: user repository
    All extended database query operations using doctrine should be
    abstracted in a repository

    Scenario: remove pending activations
        Given the following users exist:
            | username | password | email                  | activation_date | is_non_activated |
            | 0        | 123456   | 0@sententiaregum.dev   | -3 hours        | true             |
            | 1        | 123456   | 1@sententiaregum.dev   | -3 hours        | true             |
            | foo      | 123456   | foo@sententiaregum.dev | -1 day          | false            |
        When I try to delete all users with pending activation
        Then one user should still exist
        And two users should be removed

    Scenario: get follower ids
        Given the user fixtures have been applied
        When I ask for a list of follower ids for user "Ma27"
        Then I should get two ids

    Scenario: load follower by activation key and username
        Given the database is purged
        And the following users exist:
            | user_id | username | password | email          | activation_key | is_non_activated |
            | 1       | Ma27     | 123456   | test@localhost | 1234key1234    | true             |
        When I'd like to see a user by with username "Ma27" and key "1234key1234"
        Then I should see the user with id "1"
